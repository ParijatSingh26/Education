        <h3>Course Overview</h3>
        <p>The idea of the Web started with Tim Berners-Lee during 1989, while he was working at CERN. His vision was to create a global level hypertext based project, and his implementation with a browser was with WorldWideWeb in 1991. During the early days only text based pages could be used on single lined web browsers. There was no integration of multimedia elements like images, sound and others. However the arrival of the Mosaic web browser allowed integration of multimedia elements. In October 1994, W3C was founded to develop standards for the Web, which process still continues. Since about 2000, many browsers like Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome have been released into the market, and new browsers are still coming.<br><br>

            Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.
            The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.
            <br><br>
            One popular tool in web design is UX Design, it is a type of art that designs products to perform an accurate user background. UX design is very deep. UX is more than the web, it is very independent, and its fundamentals can be applied to many other browsers or apps. Web design is mostly based on web-based things. UX can overlap both web design and design. UX design mostly focuses on products that are less web based.
            Web designers may choose to limit the variety of website typefaces to only a few which are of a similar style, instead of using a wide range of typefaces or type styles. Most browsers recognize a specific number of safe fonts, which designers mainly use in order to avoid complications.
            <br><br>
            Font downloading was later included in the CSS3 fonts module and has since been implemented in Safari 3.1, Opera 10, and Mozilla Firefox 3.5. This has subsequently increased interest in web typography, as well as the usage of font downloading.

            Most site layouts incorporate negative space to break the text up into paragraphs and also avoid center-aligned text.
